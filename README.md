# AI-Powered-SMS-Automation-Bot-for-Land-Investing-CRM
Create an AI text bot that can automate the process of sending range offers for our land investing company. The bot should be capable of generating personalized messages based on predefined templates and effectively integrating with our existing CRM system. This project requires expertise in AI development, messaging systems, and CRM integration to ensure seamless functionality and user experience.


1. Texting Platform/Software:
Twilio or MessageBird: These are popular platforms for sending and receiving text messages. They provide APIs that integrate with your system, allowing you to automate sending messages, responding to incoming texts, and handling opt-outs.
Alternatively, some CRM systems have built-in texting capabilities, like HubSpot or Zoho CRM, which might be suitable for managing leads and messaging.
2. AI Chatbot Software:
Dialogflow (by Google) or ChatGPT API (by OpenAI): These platforms allow you to build conversational AI models that can interpret text inputs and generate responses based on user interaction. They can help your bot understand user responses and determine the appropriate next message.
Rasa: An open-source conversational AI framework for building AI chatbots that can be customized and deployed locally or on cloud servers.
3. Lead Management & CRM:
A CRM system (like Salesforce, Zoho CRM, or HubSpot) helps you store and manage leads, track interactions, and update records as your bot generates responses. Integrating the CRM with your texting bot ensures all conversations and lead data are tracked.
4. Workflow Automation:
Zapier or Make (Integromat): These no-code automation tools allow you to connect different services (like your CRM, AI chatbot, and texting platform) and automate workflows without needing to code.
For a more advanced setup, you can use Node-RED (open-source) for creating custom automation flows.
5. Data Analysis and Lead Scoring:
Excel or Google Sheets for simple data management.
Tableau, Power BI, or Google Data Studio for visualizing data trends and analyzing lead quality.
A basic AI model (using Python libraries like scikit-learn or TensorFlow) could help score leads based on interaction data.
6. Backend Development:
If you want a custom solution, you might need to develop a backend using Python (Flask/Django) or JavaScript (Node.js). This backend can host your AI models, manage conversations, and process data before sending messages.
Use Firebase or AWS for scalable database management, especially if you need to store large amounts of lead data.
7. Compliance Tools:
DNC (Do Not Call) List Scrubbing Services to ensure compliance with texting regulations.
Platforms like Twilio Verify can help verify phone numbers before sending messages.
Process Overview:
Set Up a Texting Platform: Choose a service like Twilio to handle SMS sending and receiving.
Create Your AI Model: Use Dialogflow or OpenAI's API to build a conversational model that can handle various responses and make range offers.
Integrate CRM: Connect a CRM to store leads and manage interactions.
Automate: Use Zapier or a custom backend to automate the flow of data between your texting platform, AI model, and CRM.
Test and Iterate: Test the bot's responses, ensure it follows regulatory guidelines, and refine its conversational flow.
===========================
We'll use Twilio for texting, OpenAI's GPT API for generating personalized messages, and a CRM like Zoho CRM or HubSpot for managing leads. Workflow automation will be facilitated using Zapier, while compliance with SMS regulations will be ensured.
Steps to Implement

    Set Up Twilio:
        Sign up for Twilio and get an API key.
        Create a messaging service to handle incoming and outgoing texts.

    AI Integration:
        Use OpenAI's GPT API to generate text messages dynamically.
        Define templates for range offers with placeholders for personalization.

    CRM Integration:
        Use the CRM API to fetch lead data and update conversation logs.

    Backend:
        Use Flask to handle API calls between Twilio, OpenAI, and CRM.

    Automation:
        Use Zapier for no-code automation of workflows.

Python Code Implementation
Install Required Libraries

pip install flask twilio openai requests python-dotenv

Flask Backend

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from twilio.rest import Client
import openai
import requests
import os

app = Flask(__name__)

# Load environment variables
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID = os.getenv('TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID')
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN = os.getenv('TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN')
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER = os.getenv('TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER')
OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY')
CRM_API_KEY = os.getenv('CRM_API_KEY')  # Example for Zoho or HubSpot

# Twilio client
twilio_client = Client(TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN)

# OpenAI API key
openai.api_key = OPENAI_API_KEY

# Generate a personalized message using OpenAI GPT
def generate_message(lead_name, lead_details, offer_range):
    prompt = f"""
    Create a polite, professional SMS to a lead named {lead_name}. Mention their interest in {lead_details['property']} and make a range offer of {offer_range}.
    """
    response = openai.Completion.create(
        engine="text-davinci-003",
        prompt=prompt,
        max_tokens=150
    )
    return response.choices[0].text.strip()

# Send SMS via Twilio
def send_sms(to_number, message):
    twilio_client.messages.create(
        body=message,
        from_=TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER,
        to=to_number
    )

# Fetch leads from CRM
def fetch_leads_from_crm():
    crm_url = "https://your-crm-api-endpoint"  # Replace with CRM API endpoint
    headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {CRM_API_KEY}"}
    response = requests.get(f"{crm_url}/leads", headers=headers)
    return response.json()  # Assume JSON response

# Endpoint to send range offers
@app.route('/send-range-offers', methods=['POST'])
def send_range_offers():
    leads = fetch_leads_from_crm()  # Fetch leads
    offer_range = request.json.get('offer_range', "$50,000 - $70,000")

    for lead in leads:
        lead_name = lead['name']
        lead_phone = lead['phone']
        lead_details = lead.get('details', {})
        message = generate_message(lead_name, lead_details, offer_range)
        send_sms(lead_phone, message)

    return jsonify({"status": "success", "message": "Range offers sent to all leads."})

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)

Integration with CRM

Modify the fetch_leads_from_crm function based on your CRM provider:

    Zoho CRM: Use Zoho CRM's REST API with OAuth2.
    HubSpot: Use HubSpot's API to fetch lead details and update logs.

AI Template Examples

    Range Offer Template:

    Hi {lead_name}, this is {agent_name} from [Company]. I noticed you're interested in {property}. Based on your interest, weâ€™d like to offer a range of {offer_range}. Let us know your thoughts!

Compliance & Error Handling

    Opt-Out Compliance:
        Add a check to ensure the lead has not opted out before sending messages.
        Example: "Reply STOP to unsubscribe".

    Error Handling:
        Implement error logging for failed messages.
        Retry failed messages using Twilioâ€™s messaging feedback.

Automation with Zapier

    Trigger: Use a Zapier webhook to invoke the /send-range-offers endpoint.
    Action: Automate lead updates in the CRM after message delivery.

Future Enhancements

    Use Dialogflow to handle incoming SMS responses and engage in a two-way conversation.
    Add lead scoring using response rates and update CRM records dynamically.
    Implement advanced analytics dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI.
